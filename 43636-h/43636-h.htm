<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Largest</span> of all the fair West Indian Islands
which lie in our open doorway is Cuba. The
great south doorway to the United States and
all North America, you know, is the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>But recently, as we all remember, we have
had war and bloodshed at this doorway. The
Spanish government, in trying to subdue its
rebellious province of Cuba, brought great
hardship and suffering upon the Cuban people,
our neighbours, and our government at last
decided that such things must not be at our
very doorway. So to-day Cuba is free, and
the great trouble of war is over and past for
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, though war no longer troubles the
Cuban people, they have many new hardships
and difficulties to contend with, and need the
friendly help of their more fortunate neighbours
scarcely less than before. Now, in
order that we may be able to help our friends
and neighbours, the Cubans, we must know
them better, and surely we shall all feel a
stronger interest than ever before in their welfare.
So we shall be glad to meet and know
our little Cuban neighbour, Maria.</p>

<p>We shall ask to have what Maria says
translated for us, for most of us do not understand
the Spanish language, which Maria
speaks. We must remember, too, to pronounce
her name as if it were spelled Mahreeah,
for that is the way she and her family
pronounce it. Our Cuban cousins, you know,
like our cousins in Porto Rico, are descended
from the dark-eyed, dark-haired Spanish people.
Their forefathers came over seas from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Spain to Cuba, as the English colonists came
across the ocean to our country, which is now
the United States.</p>

<p>Yet we must remember that the Spanish
people and the English people are near akin
in the great human family. They both belong
to the white race; and so we shall call our
black-eyed little neighbour our near cousin.
Welcome, then, to our little Cuban cousin!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DANGER.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Maria!</span> Maria! Maria!" was the low
call from some unknown direction. It sounded
like a whisper, yet it must have travelled from
a distance. Low as it was, the little girl dozing
in the hammock in the lemon grove was awake
in an instant. She sprang out and stood with
hands shading her eyes, looking for the owner
of the voice.</p>

<p>She well knew what it meant. Ramon was
the only one who had agreed to call in this
way. It was a sign of danger! It meant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
"The enemy are coming. Look out and get
ready." Shouldn't you think our little Cuban
cousin would have trembled and cried, or at
least run for protection to her mother?</p>

<p>Maria was only nine years old. She was a
perfect fairy of a child, with tiny hands and
feet and soft black eyes. But she was used to
war by this time. She never knew when she
went to sleep at night but that her home
would be burnt down by the cruel Spaniards
before the end of another day.</p>

<p>Ramon got up before sunrise this morning.
He had been away from home for several
hours. He had gone out in the country "to
look around," as he said. From his own front
door the burning roofs of the houses of old
friends not a mile distant could be seen the
night before. The Spanish troops must be
near. Who could say but that the boy's own
home would suffer next?</p>

<p>He was tall and active, and he longed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
much to help his people. They had suffered
much from their Spanish rulers and now they
were working hard for freedom. But Ramon's
father had been ill for a long time. He was
growing weaker every day. The boy's mother
looked very sad at times. Her eyes filled
with tears when she said:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you must not leave us now.
Your duty lies at home. You must be your
father's right hand and protect your little
sisters and myself."</p>

<p>The Diaz children lived in a cosy little
home in the country. It was only a few miles
from Havana. Their father had a small sugar
plantation. He had been able to raise enough
sugar to buy everything the family needed
until lately. But now times were very hard.
It was not easy to sell the sugar; besides this,
the good man and his family were in constant
danger.</p>

<p>What had they done? you ask. Nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
They did not love their Spanish rulers, to be
sure, and they believed their countrymen were
fighting justly to free their beautiful island
home. They would help these countrymen,
or insurgents, as they were called, if they had
a chance.</p>

<p>But Maria's father had never, himself,
fought against the Spaniards. He was a quiet,
kindly gentleman, and he had no love for war.
What did the Spaniards care for that? They
might say to themselves:</p>

<p>"This man has a pleasant home. He raises
sugar. He may give food and shelter to those
daring Cuban soldiers. Then they can keep
up their strength and be able to keep up the
fight against us all the longer."</p>

<p>So far Maria's home had been spared.
Although many other houses near her had
been burned, hers stood safe and unharmed
yet. But "To-morrow is another day," the
child often repeated to herself, after the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of her people. That meant, "Although I
am safe now, no one knows what will come
next." Then Maria would sigh for a moment
and look sad. But she was naturally merry
and gay, and the next moment would be dancing
about and humming a lively tune.</p>

<p>What news was her brave brother bringing
this morning? As soon as he came in sight,
Maria ran to meet him. The sun was very
hot and the little girl's head was bare, but she
did not think of these things. The Spaniards!
The Spaniards! made the only picture she
could see.</p>

<p>As soon as she was within easy call, Ramon
told her that a company of the enemy was only
two miles away. He had been very close to
them. He had even heard them talking together
while he hid in the bushes.</p>

<p>"Just think, Maria," he exclaimed, "they
were laughing at the easy time they would
have in breaking our spirit. They said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
before long they would starve us into giving
up. I rather think they won't. Do you
know, Maria, I believe God will send us help
if we are only patient. The Americans live
so near us, I don't see how they can help taking
our part, when they know the way we are
treated. But come, we must hurry and tell
father the news. He will know what we
ought to do to get ready for a visit to-day."</p>

<p>The children hurried to the house, and
soon every one was in a state of the greatest
excitement. When Señor Diaz was told of
the approach of the Spaniards, he said, in his
gentle voice, "We would best have a picnic."</p>

<p>The children looked greatly astonished at
the idea of a picnic at such a time, but their
father went on to explain. He had often
thought of the coming of the Spanish troops.
He had made a plan in case he should hear of
their approach. The house should be locked
up; all the family should go down to the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of a small lake a quarter of a mile back in the
woods. The path that led to this lake was so
hidden that a stranger would not know it was
there. Ramon could lead the oxen; the father
thought that he was strong enough to guide
the horse to the picnic-ground.</p>

<p>If the Spaniards found no one about the
house, and no animals worth capturing, they
might possibly pass by without doing any
harm.</p>

<p>Señora Diaz and old black Paulina got a
hasty luncheon ready. Maria said she must
certainly take her sewing materials, for she
was going to embroider some insurgent emblems.
Her little sister, Isabella, carried her
pet kitten in her arms, and cried because the
parrot must be left behind.</p>

<p>"He'll be so lonesome," she said; "and I
just know he'll call 'Isabella' all day long."</p>

<p>The dear little girl cried hard, but everybody's
hands were so full that Mr. Poll was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
left in the house. A big linen cloth was
stretched over the cage. If kept in the dark,
he would probably be still, and not attract the
attention of the soldiers, if they stopped and
looked in. The black man servant, Miguel,
stayed behind to shut up the chickens in
barrels, but would follow the rest of the party
in a few moments.</p>

<p>The path led in and out through the beautiful
southern woods. There were cocoanut-palms
and ebony and mahogany trees, while
underneath were creeping vines and bushes,
making a close thicket of underbrush. There
was no talking. The family crept along as
quietly as possible, lest they should be heard
and followed. For by this time the enemy
must be very near.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PICNIC.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few minutes the lake was in sight. It
was a very pretty sheet of water. A tiny boat
rocked to and fro close to the shore, for
Ramon and Maria often came here to row
about the quiet lake.</p>

<p>Ramon soon had two hammocks swinging
between the trees for his father and mother.
The lunch was spread out on the ground, as
it was already past the time for the noonday
meal.</p>

<p>"What did they have to eat?" you ask.
There were some delicate white rolls, that
Paulina knew how to make so nicely. There
was guava jelly to eat on the rolls; fresh
lemons and newly made sugar from which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
make a refreshing drink. Besides these, there
was plenty of cold fried chicken. Could any
children have a nicer picnic lunch than this,
even if a long time had been spent in getting
ready for it?</p>

<p>The guava jelly looked just as clear and
beautiful as that which is brought to America,
and sold here at such a high price. Did you
ever see it in the stores of Boston or New
York, and think how nice it must taste? Perhaps
your mother has bought it for you when
you were getting well after a long illness, and
wished to tempt your appetite by some new
dainty. Maria has several guava-trees near
her home. Paulina makes so much jelly from
the ripe fruit that perhaps the little girl does
not realise how nice it is.</p>

<p>After the lunch, Señor Diaz stretched himself
in one of the hammocks for a quiet rest.
He was very tired after his walk through the
woods. He was also troubled over the sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
state of things in his country, and was worried
that he was not strong enough to take a more
active part against the enemy. His wife lay
down in the other hammock for a noonday
nap, after which she promised to help Maria
in her sewing.</p>

<p>Paulina gathered the remains of the lunch
and put things in order, while the three
children rowed around the lake.</p>

<p>"Won't you hear me read out of my
primer, Maria?" said Isabella. "Ramon,
dear, give your oars a rest, and float for
a little while. You can listen, too, and I
know you'll like my lesson to-day."</p>

<p>The little girl was just learning to read, and
she had a book printed by the insurgents.
No one had to urge her to study, for even
her own little primer was made up of stories
about the war. She had tucked her loved book
in the loose waist of her dress when she left
the house. No one had noticed it before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="boy looking at fort in the distance" />
<div class="caption">"'I COUNTED THREE DIFFERENT FORTS OF THE ENEMY'"</div>
</div>

<p>"Why, yes, my darling sister, certainly I
will listen, and help you with the big words,
too," answered Maria, while Ramon drew in
his oars, and lay back in the boat with a
pleasant smile. Of course the words were all
Spanish, because that was the only language
the children had ever learned. Isabella read:</p>

<p>"My papa is in the army of the Cubans.
He fights to make us free. Do you hear the
cannon roar? Our men will bring victory.
Long live Cuba!"</p>

<p>When Isabella came to the word "victory,"
Maria had to help her. It was such a big
word for the six-year-old child to pronounce.
She looked at it again and again, repeating it
slowly to herself. Then she said:</p>

<p>"I'll never fail on that word again, Maria,
no matter where it is. How I would like to
see it in great big letters on a silk banner!
I'd wave it all day long."</p>

<p>This was a good deal for such a little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to say, but then, you know, she was living
in the midst of war.</p>

<p>"Good for you," said her brother; "we'll
all live yet to see the words of your primer
come true. Long live free Cuba! I say. But
come, let's go on shore, and play war. You
and Maria can be the Spaniards, and I'll be
the insurgent army. You just see how I will
make short work of taking you prisoners."</p>

<p>The children landed under a big cotton-tree.
They made a fort out of dead branches
which they gathered. This fort was to belong
to the Spanish troops. The two girls placed
themselves behind it, and stood ready to defend
themselves. It was not many minutes
before Ramon took them by surprise, and
dragged them to the boat, which stood for
the Cuban headquarters.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the boy, when they
stopped to rest a few minutes from their sport,
"I counted three different forts of the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
during my tramp this morning. The cowardly
Spaniards don't dare to march very far away
from those forts. They really don't give our
men a chance to have a good fair battle.
They think by having plenty of forts they
can keep our soldiers from getting into the
cities. Then they will scare the rest of us
who live in the country from feeding them.
In that way we will be starved into giving in.
We'll see, that's all."</p>

<p>By this time Maria could see that her
mother had waked up and left the hammock.</p>

<p>"She will be ready to help me with my
work now," said Maria. "Don't you want
to come and watch me embroider, Isabella?"</p>

<p>The two girls were soon sitting beside their
mother, while Ramon went with Miguel on a
hunt for birds. The insurgent emblems which
Maria was so eager to make were to be given
to the Cuban soldiers. They were to wear
beneath their coats. Suppose that an insurgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
should stop at any place, and ask
for food and rest; how would the people
know that he was true to his country, and
not a friend of the Spaniards? He could
show his little piece of flannel with the watchword
of the Cubans embroidered upon it.
That was the only thing needed. The people
would be safe now in giving him help.</p>

<p>Maria did her work very nicely. She made
a scalloped edge with red silk all around the
white cloth. A crimson heart on a green
cross must then be made, with underneath
these words:</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer. The heart of Jesus is
with me."</p>

<p>Two hours went by before Ramon came
back. Miguel and he were bringing a large
net full of birds. Of course, they had done
no shooting. That would not have been wise
when Spanish soldiers might be near to hear
the noise. No, they had searched through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the woods till they found some sour orange
trees. The fruit was ripe now and there were
sure to be numbers of parrots around. They
could be caught in the net that Miguel had
brought from the house that morning. They
had to creep along very quietly so as to take
the birds by surprise.</p>

<p>They had great success, it seemed; but what
would the family do with a dozen dead parrots?
Eat them, to be sure. Paulina would
make a fine stew for dinner that very night.
That is, of course, if they were fortunate enough
to find the house still standing when they
reached home. The flesh of this bird is tough,
and one wonders that Ramon and Maria are
so fond of parrot stew. In Cuba there are
many nicer birds for eating. But each one has
his own tastes. No two people are alike, we
have found out long ago.</p>

<p>"I discovered something in the woods that
I want to show you girls," said Ramon. "It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
only a little ways off. Won't you come, too,
mamma? It's the dearest little nest I ever
saw in my life. It must belong to a humming-bird."</p>

<p>Ramon's mother and the children followed
him till the boy stopped in front of a low
bush. Hidden away under the leaves was the
tiny nest. It was no bigger than a large thimble.
It was made of cotton, bound together
with two or three horse-hairs.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I couldn't have sewed it as well
as that," said Maria. "See how the threads
are woven in and out. It's wonderful what
birds can do. But look at the eggs, mamma
dear. See! there are two of them. They
aren't any bigger than peas."</p>

<p>Just then the children heard a fluttering of
tiny wings. It was Mrs. Humming-Bird who
had come home. She was troubled at the
sight of the strangers.</p>

<p>"Did you ever before see such a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bird?" whispered Isabella. "She looks like
a butterfly, and a small one, too. Aren't
her colours beautiful?"</p>

<p>"We would best let her go back to her nest,
now, my dears," said Señora Diaz. "You
can watch, Ramon, and find out when the
baby birds hatch. We shall all like to see
them, I'm sure."</p>

<p>They left the bush and turned back toward
the lake. Ramon stopped again, however,
when they came to a small lace-wood tree.</p>

<p>"You know you asked me to get you some
of the wood to trim your doll's dress, Isabella.
Here is a good chance to get it. I'll follow
you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Ramon took out his knife, and soon the
young tree was cut away from the roots. It
would take some time to strip off the bark.
It must be done carefully and peeled off in
one piece, so as to leave the pith of the tree
quite smooth and whole. Several strips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
delicate lace could be obtained from this pith.
Now Isabella would be able to dress her doll
in great elegance. She could ruffle the lace on
the waist and flounces of the doll's skirt and
make it look as beautiful as though it cost a
good deal of money. Isabella herself has
a dress trimmed with the lace, but Paulina
needs to be very careful when she irons it. It
was growing dark when Ramon arrived at the
shore with his tree.</p>

<p>"We will go back now," said Señor Diaz,
"and see if the soldiers have left us our
home."</p>

<p>All were soon making their way back to the
house, which they found unharmed. Nothing
had been touched by the enemy. Perhaps
they had not thought it worth while to stop.
At any rate, there was great joy in the Diaz
family that evening as they sat on the balcony,
sipping cups of hot sweetened water. The
times were so hard they could not buy coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and <i>guaraba</i>, as they called it, was the next
best thing. Maria is very fond of it.</p>

<p>The children were so tired from the day's
excitement that by eight o'clock they were
quite ready to go to dreamland. Isabella
started first. She went up to her father and,
placing her tiny hands across her breast, looked
up into his eyes with a sweet, solemn look.
He knew at once what it meant. She was
asking an evening blessing before leaving him
for the night. Every one in the room stopped
talking; all bowed their heads while the kind
father said:</p>

<p>"May God bless my darling child, and all
others of this household."</p>

<p>Maria and Ramon followed Isabella's example,
and soon the children were sound
asleep. Isabella dreamed that she taught her
loved parrot to say "Liberty," and was delighted
at her success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LEGENDS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning it rained quite hard, so
the children had to stay in the house.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with ourselves?" said
Maria. "Oh, I know. We'll ask father to
tell us stories."</p>

<p>"What shall it be to-day?" he asked. "Do
you want a tale of old Spain, or shall it be
the life of Columbus; or maybe you would
like a fairy story?"</p>

<p>"A fairy story! A fairy story!" all cried
together.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, this shall be a tale that
our people heard in Europe a thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>"It was long before Columbus dreamed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his wonderful voyages across the Atlantic. It
was before people had even thought of the
idea of the roundness of the earth. They had
such queer fancies in those days. Few men
dared to sail far into the West. They believed
that if they did so they would come
into a place of perfect darkness.</p>

<p>"Still they had one legend of a land across
the Atlantic that was very beautiful. Many
of our greatest men believed in it. It was
called the Island of Youth, and people who
reached it could live for ever, and never grow
old."</p>

<p>"What made them think there was such a
place?" asked Maria, with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"They had heard that long ago there was a
very brave young man. He had a wonderful
horse as white as the foam of the ocean.
Strange to say, this horse could carry him
through the water more safely than the
stoutest boat. As he was looking for adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he started off on the back of his
fairy steed to cross the ocean.</p>

<p>"After he had travelled for some distance,
he stopped to kill a giant who had enchanted
a princess. When the giant was dead, and
the beautiful maiden was free once more, he
travelled on till he came to a land where the
trees were loaded with birds. The air was
filled with their sweet music.</p>

<p>"He stayed in this land for a hundred
years. He was merry and gay all the time.
He was never ill, and never tired."</p>

<p>"But wasn't he lonesome?" asked Ramon.
"I should think he would wish for other
company besides the birds."</p>

<p>"Oh, there were many other people there,
of course, and as our traveller was fond of
shooting, he had great sport hunting the deer.</p>

<p>"But at last something happened to make
him think of his old home and friends. It
was a rusty spear that came floating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shore one day. It must have travelled across
the ocean. The young man grew sad with
longing for the scenes of his early days. He
mounted his white steed once more, plunged
into the ocean, and at last reached his own
home.</p>

<p>"But think, children. It was a hundred
years since he had seen it. His old friends
were all dead. The people seemed like dwarfs.
I suppose he must have grown in size and
strength while away on the Island of Youth.
At any rate, his own home was not what he
expected to find it. He had no wish to live
longer. He lay down and died. The Island
of Youth had not been such a great blessing
to him, after all.</p>

<p>"Another story used to be told in Spain of
the Island of Seven Cities. It was a legend
of our own Cuba, for all we know. People
said that a thousand years before Columbus
crossed the Atlantic, an archbishop was driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
away from Spain. Why was it? He was
untrue to his king. He sailed far from his
country with a goodly company of men and
women.</p>

<p>"After a long voyage they reached a land
which they called Antilla. There were people
already living here. They were kind and
gentle.</p>

<p>"The archbishop divided the land into
seven parts. He built churches and other
fine buildings. He got the natives to help
him. All lived together in peace and
happiness.</p>

<p>"But look, children, the rain has stopped
falling, and the sun is shining. You can go
outdoors now, and amuse yourselves. Before
you leave, however, let me ask you a question
in geography.</p>

<p>"Cuba is shaped like what animal? Think
how long and narrow it is, and of the ridge of
mountains running through the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
island. I will give you until to-morrow to
guess the answer.</p>

<p>"And, by the way, did you ever think that
our home is really the top of a row of mountains
reaching up from the floor of the ocean?
Ah, what wonders would be seen in the valleys
below us, if we could journey under the
water, and explore it for ourselves!"</p>

<p>Just as the good man stopped speaking,
Miguel knocked at the door. Two ragged
little girls were standing at his side. They
were strangers. Where had they come from
during the hard rain of the morning?</p>

<p>It seemed that Miguel had been tramping
through the woods after game. He did not
care for the rain. He was a good-natured
servant, and was always ready to make pleasant
surprises for the family. When he was
about four miles from home, he came upon an
unexpected camp. There were about thirty
people in it. There, on the mountainside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
they had made rough huts to live in. There
were not only men and women, but little
children, also. They had been here for two
or three weeks.</p>

<p>What a sad story they had to tell! It was
the old story. They wished to be peaceful;
they did not join the army of the Cubans.
Still, they might possibly help them in some
little way. But they did not go to the great
city. They fled to the woods on the mountainside.
They kept themselves from starving
by gathering berries and wild fruit. Their
children were sent out every morning to the
country homes which were not too far off to
beg for food and help.</p>

<p>"Poor little children!" exclaimed Maria,
when Miguel had finished his story. "We
will help you all we can, won't we, papa?"
And the child's eyes were full of tears, as she
said:</p>

<p>"We may be homeless like them, yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Isabella ran to call her mother and ask her
help. Clothing was collected, and all the
food the family could spare was put into
baskets. It was far too large a load for the
little girls to carry, so Ramon and Miguel
went with them.</p>

<p>"What a good servant Miguel is!" said
Señor Diaz to his wife, after they were gone.
"So many of the blacks are lazy, and only
think of their own comfort. But Miguel
is always good-natured and ready to help."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOURS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a beautiful Sunday morning. The
birds were singing gaily outside. Maria
opened her eyes. Perhaps she would have
slept longer if she had not been wakened by
a sound in the next room. It was Ramon
who was calling.</p>

<p>"Say, Maria, what shall we do to-day while
father and mother are gone to church? Let's
go over to the plantation. You know we've
been invited ever so many times, and it is
such fun watching the men at work."</p>

<p>"All right," said Maria, "but there's no
hurry. We will wait till after the folks have
gone before we start."</p>

<p>Just beyond the home of the Diaz children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was an immense sugar plantation. It covered
at least a square mile of land. The rich
planter who owned it employed more than
a hundred black men. It was cutting season
now, and the work was carried on day and
night, both Sundays and week-days. Sunday
afternoon, however, was a half-holiday, even
in the busiest time, and the black people then
gave themselves up to merrymaking, no matter
how tired they were.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="people in a volante" />
<div class="caption">"THEY SAT BACK IN THE LOW, BROAD SEAT"</div>
</div>

<p>By nine o'clock Señor Diaz and his wife
had left home in the oddest-looking carriage
you ever heard of. It was a <i>volante</i>. There
is nothing like it anywhere else in the world.
It looked somewhat like an old-fashioned
chaise. It had immense wheels, and the
shafts were at least sixteen feet long.</p>

<p>We think at once, how clumsily one must
move along in such a carriage. But it is not
so. It is the best thing possible for travelling
over the rough roads of Cuba. It swings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
along from side to side so easily that a person
is not bumped or jostled as he would be in
any other kind of carriage. But one does not
see many new volantes in Cuba now. They
are going out of fashion.</p>

<p>Señor Diaz was very proud of this carriage
when it was new. It was trimmed with bands
of silver. It had beautiful silk cushions.
Even now, the good man and his wife looked
quite elegant as they sat back in the low,
broad seat. Isabella sat between them.</p>

<p>Miguel rode on the horse's back as driver.
He wore a scarlet jacket trimmed with gold
braid. He had on high boots with spurs at
his heels. He felt very proud. It made very
little difference to him that his coat was badly
torn and the braid was tarnished. These were
war-times and one could not expect new
clothes.</p>

<p>"If the people at the great house invite you
to stay till evening, you may do so," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Señor Diaz to his two older children just as he
was driving away. "I know you will be gentlemanly,
Ramon; and Maria dear, my little
daughter will certainly be quiet and ladylike."</p>

<p>Away swung the volante down the road,
while Ramon and Maria put on their wide
straw hats and started across the fields for the
rich sugar planter's home. They looked very
pretty as they moved along under the shade-trees.
Both were barefooted; Maria wore a
simple white dress, and Ramon a linen shirt
and trousers.</p>

<p>They reached their neighbour's grounds in
a few minutes. They soon found themselves
in front of a large, low house with beautiful
gardens and shade-trees around it. But of
what was the house made? It was of the
same material as Maria's home, yet we see
nothing like it in our own country. It was
neither brick, nor wood, nor stone. Maria
would say to us:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, this is 'adobe,' and it keeps out
the sun's hot rays nicely. Don't you know
what adobe is? It is a mixture of clay and
sand dried by the sun. Some people call it
unburnt brick. It was nearly white when the
house was new, but now you see it is quite
yellow."</p>

<p>There was no glass in the window-cases.
In such a warm land as Cuba glass would keep
out the air too much, and the people inside
would suffer from the heat. But there were
iron bars across the casements; there were also
shutters to protect the house from the sun and
rain.</p>

<p>The children went in at the door, opened
by a black servant. She looked kind and
pleasant, and showed two rows of white teeth
as she smiled at the young visitors. A gorgeous
yellow bandanna was wound around her
head.</p>

<p>"Come right in, little dears. Massa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
missus will be glad to see you; little Miss
Lucia has been wishing for company to-day."</p>

<p>She led Ramon and Maria into a large
sitting-room with two rows of rocking-chairs
opposite each other. They stretched nearly
from one end of the room to the other. There
was scarcely any other furniture.</p>

<p>A minute afterward, Lucia opened the door.
She was about Maria's age and very pretty.
But she was dressed like a grown-up young
lady. She carried in her hand a dainty little
fan, which she moved gracefully as she talked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you," she cried.
"But let us go out into the garden; it is much
pleasanter there; don't you think so? I want
to show you my sensitive plant. Did you
ever have one?"</p>

<p>Maria and Ramon had heard their father
speak of this plant, but they had never happened
to see one themselves. They followed
Lucia out on the balcony. A morning-glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
vine was trailing up the trelliswork. It was
bright with its delicate blossoms, pink and
blue and purple. Close beside it was the
sensitive plant.</p>

<p>"It came up of itself," said Lucia. "That
is, you know, it was not planted by any one.
You see its leaves are wide open now. It is
keeping the morning-glory blossoms company.
Perhaps they are talking together. Who
knows? But when night comes it will close
up in the same way as the petals of its
next-door neighbour."</p>

<p>"Now, Ramon, just touch the leaves
gently."</p>

<p>"Why, it acts as if afraid of me, doesn't
it?" said the boy. "See how it shrinks away,
even before I take hold of it. I declare, it
knows more than some animals."</p>

<p>"Would you like to ride around the plantation?
We have three ponies; so each one of
us can have one," said their little hostess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Her visitors were delighted at the idea.
While a servant was sent for the ponies the
children sat down under a royal palm-tree.
It stood at least sixty feet high. Its trunk
was perfectly straight. Far up at the top was
the wide-spreading plume of leaves. There
were no branches at the sides.</p>

<p>"I just love this tree," said Lucia. "It
seems so strong as well as beautiful. Isn't it
queer that the trunk of such a big tree should
be hollow?"</p>

<p>"I think it queerer still that the roots
should be so small and fine," answered
Ramon. "Did you ever eat what is found
at the top of the royal palm? Everybody
says it is delicious."</p>

<p>"Yes, we had it boiled once for a dinner-party,"
said Lucia. "It was delicious, but
you know it kills the tree to take it off; so
father says it is almost wicked to get it. I
think he is right."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUGAR.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this time the ponies had been brought
up, and the young riders started off.</p>

<p>How high the sugar-canes stood! The
children could not see over the tops, even
from their ponies' backs. The long, narrow
leaves hung down much like our own Indian
corn. Far up on each plant was a feathery
white plume. The stalks were now a golden
yellow colour. This was Mother Nature's
sign that the cane was full of sap.</p>

<p>At Maria's home the cane had been already
cut and made into sugar. But there were
only two or three fields. Here, on Lucia's
plantation, there were hundreds of acres. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
men had been working for weeks already, and
it was not yet half cut.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Ramon!" said Maria, "see that
dear little black baby asleep between the canes.
She can't be more than two years old. The
other children must have gone away and forgotten
her."</p>

<p>Ramon jumped down, and, picking up the
little tot, lifted her up in front of him on
the pony's back. She had been waked up
so suddenly that she began to cry. But
when the others smiled at her she rolled
her big eyes around, and soon began to
laugh. She was going to have a ride with
white children, and that was a grand event in
her life.</p>

<p>A turn in the rough road showed an ox-cart
ahead. How small the Cuban oxen are!
But they are such gentle, patient creatures, a
child could drive them. How they pushed
ahead with their heavy load!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were young a hole had been
bored through the centre of their nostrils, and
an iron ring was passed through. When the
oxen were harnessed a rope was fastened on
each side of this ring. The black driver held
the ends of the rope, and guided the oxen.
He had no whip, for it was not needed.</p>

<p>"Let's follow him up to the top of the hill,"
said Lucia. "He must carry his load to the
boiler-house that way, and I do like to watch
the oxen go down a steep place. There, see!
The man will not even get off; he's perfectly
safe."</p>

<p>As the heavily loaded wagon passed over
the brow of the hill, the oxen squatted down
like dogs, and seemed to slide rather than
walk, till they reached the foot.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" shouted Ramon. "I'd trust
such creatures anywhere. They ought to be
rewarded with a good supper to-night. And
now that they have reached level ground see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
how well they trot along. These dear little
ponies cannot do much better."</p>

<p>The children still followed the ox-cart, and
soon reached the sugar-mill. Immense machines
were crushing the canes, and the sap
was flowing into great tanks from which it was
afterward taken to be boiled.</p>

<p>"What does the molasses come from?"
you may ask. All Cuban children would tell
you at once that it is the drippings from the
newly made sugar.</p>

<p>Lucia's father does not sell his molasses, as
do many other planters. He thinks it is not
worth while. You cannot guess what use he
makes of it. His work-people spread it on
the ground to make it richer for the next
year's crop.</p>

<p>His wife does not think of having it used in
cooking, either, as American women do, and so
Lucia has never tasted gingerbread in her life.
Perhaps you feel sorry for her. Never mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
She enjoys sucking the juice from the fresh
sugar-cane as well as the black children on
her father's plantation; she has as much of
this as she wishes, so she never misses the
molasses cookies and cakes you like so much.</p>

<p>"Lucia, how is it your father keeps on
having the cane cut?" asked Ramon, as the
children stood watching the sap boiling down
to sugar. "You know, don't you, a new law
has been passed ordering the work stopped?
It is all because the Spaniards are afraid that
the poor insurgents will get food and help
from the sugar planters."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">

<div class="caption">"THE MACHINES MADE A STEADY, GRINDING SOUND"</div>
</div>
<p>"Yes, I know," answered Lucia. "I heard
father talking about it. He said he had paid
the government a large sum of money to let
him keep on. So he's all right. But perhaps
I ought not to have said this, for it is his own
business, and I should not repeat what I hear."</p>

<p>The children entered the sugar-mill, and
stood watching the workers. Every one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
so busy that no notice was taken of the young
visitors. Here were great troughs full of the
canes which were being crushed by heavy
rollers; the juice was flowing fast into the
tanks below. And there were the caldrons
full of the boiling syrup; by their sides stood
men with long, heavy skimmers stirring the
juice, and taking off the scum which rose to
the surface.</p>



<p>There were large, shallow pans close by,
where the sugar was placed to cool. The air
was full of the sweet smell of the sugar; the
engines were clanking noisily; the machines
made a steady, grinding sound, and, above all,
the cries of the negroes could be heard, as
they called to each other at their work.</p>

<p>A few minutes was long enough for the
children to stay in this busy, steaming place.
Then they went out again into the bright,
clear air. After giving the black baby into
the charge of one of the negro girls who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
standing near by, our little cousins mounted
their ponies, and rode slowly back to the
house.</p>

<p>They passed field after field where men
were cutting down the tall sugar-canes. How
rapidly they moved along, leaving the ground
quite clear, as they passed over it! Was it
such hard work? They certainly bent over
very much as they lifted the heavy, clumsy
tools in their hands. These tools looked
somewhat like long cheese-knives, only they
were much thicker and heavier.</p>

<p>Ramon would say, "Why, those are machetes.
I wish I could use one now in defending
my country. Many a brave insurgent
has nothing else to fight with excepting the
machete he brought from his little farm. No
guns can be obtained, for the Spaniards hold
the cities, and will not allow any weapons to
get to the Cubans. But those machetes will
do great good yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>As the boy watched the men working, he
was thinking how differently he would like to
use the machete, but he did not say anything
of this kind to Lucia. He was just a little
afraid that her father was not as anxious for
Cuba to be free as he and his own parents
were.</p>

<p>When the children reached the house,
Lucia's parents insisted that Ramon and
Maria should spend the day, and a delicious
luncheon was now waiting for them.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," said the planter, "you
may go over to the quarters and see the fun.
You know it is a half-holiday, and there will
be great good times among the blacks."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE QUARTERS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a little rest in the garden, the children
started out once more. This time they
chose to walk, taking Lucia's big dog with
them for company.</p>

<p>Even before they started, they could hear
the sound of drums and shouting and laughter
coming from the quarters. They did not
have far to go before they came upon a crowd
of black children. The boys were having a
game of ball. It was so confused it would be
hard to describe it. It certainly could not
be called baseball, nor anything like it.</p>

<p>And here were the cabins, built close together.
Cocoanut and mango trees shaded
the little huts. Near each one was a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
garden where the people raised the vegetables
they liked best. Okra was sure to be seen
here, for what old mammy could be satisfied
with her Sunday dinner unless she had some
of this delicious plant in at least one of the
dishes? Here also was the chicota, much like
our summer squash, and corn, on which the
pigs must be fattened.</p>

<p>As for fruits, there were custard-apple and
sour-sop trees, the maumee, looking much
like a melon; besides many other things which
grow so easily in the warm lands. Chickens
were running about in every direction, while
there seemed as many pens with pigs grunting
inside as there were cabins.</p>

<p>How happy the people all seemed! That
is, all but a baby here and there who had
been forgotten by his mother and was crying
to keep himself company as he sprawled
about on the ground. And how grand the
women thought themselves in the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
red and yellow bandannas wound around
their heads!</p>

<p>You may be sure that all of the jewelry
the people owned was worn that day. Maria
could not help smiling at one young girl
who had immense rings in her ears, three
chains of glass beads around her neck, heavy
brass rings on her fingers, and broad bracelets
that clinked together on her arms. She
strutted around as proudly as the peacocks
near by.</p>

<p>They are handsome birds, but very vain and
silly, like this poor black girl who seemed to
admire herself so greatly. She tossed her
head from side to side as she got ready to lead
the dance.</p>

<p>The drummer bent to his work with all his
heart; one pair of dancers after another took
their places, and moved in perfect time with
faster and faster steps. The crowd of bystanders
watched them in admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the shade of a mango-tree two black
children were playing a game of dominoes.</p>

<p>"What a nice set it is," said Ramon to his
sister. "I am going to ask them if they
bought it. It must have cost quite a big sum
for them to spend."</p>

<p>The older of the two players heard Ramon's
words. He looked up with a proud smile
that made his mouth stretch from ear to ear
as he said:</p>

<p>"I made them all myself, little master. I
got the wood from an ebony-tree."</p>

<p>"But of what did you make the white
points set into the dominoes?" asked Ramon.
"They look like ivory."</p>

<p>"I cut them out of alligator's teeth, little
master. Now didn't I do well?"</p>

<p>This was said with another broad grin and
a big roll of his eyes that made Lucia and
Maria laugh in spite of themselves.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," answered Ramon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"You deserve a medal. But can you read
and write? A boy as smart as you ought to
go to school."</p>

<p>"No, little master. But that doesn't trouble
me any. I don't need any learning," was the
answer. And no doubt the little fellow had
no idea but that he was as well off as any
one need be. He could play in the sunshine
all day long and he had plenty of good food.
Wasn't his mother a fine cook, though! He
was right in thinking so, too, for she could
make the nicest "messes" out of the herbs
and vegetables growing in the little garden
behind the cabin.</p>

<p>There were melons and plantains in abundance;
salt fish or jerked beef to eat every day,
and a long sleep at night on a straw bed in the
cabin. Oh, life was a lovely thing! And
what should the little black boy know of the
cruel war and the Cuban children who had
been driven away from their homes? To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sure, he had heard sad stories in his life, but
they were about the old times when his people
were brought to Cuba as slaves. He had
listened to his father's tales of slavery, although
he himself had been free ever since he was a
little child.</p>

<p>The boy's grandfather was born far away in
Africa where the sun was always hot. He
had lived a wild, happy life in his little village
under the palm-trees by the side of a
broad river. As he grew up he hunted the
panther and the elephant, and made scarecrows
to frighten away the monkeys from the
corn-fields. He was very happy.</p>

<p>But one day a band of white men took the
village by surprise. They took many other
prisoners besides himself. The poor blacks
were put in chains and driven on board boats
in which the white men had come to the place.</p>

<p>Down the river they sailed, never more to
see their little thatched homes and have gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
feasts under the palms. At last they came to
the great ocean, where a large vessel was waiting
for them. As they were packed away in
the hold of the vessel, no notice was taken of
their cries except a lash of the whip, now and
then, across their bare backs.</p>

<p>Then came the long voyage, and the dreadful
seasickness in the crowded hold of the
vessel. Many died before the shores of Cuba
came in sight. But when those who still
lived were able once more to stand on dry
land they were too weak and sick to care
where they should go next.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, they found themselves
working under masters on the sugar
plantations, and making new homes and friends
among those who were slaves like themselves.</p>

<p>The little domino player told Manuel that
his grandfather worked so faithfully that after
awhile he was given a part of each day for
his own use. In this way he earned money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
enough to buy his own freedom as well as his
wife's. But he had children growing up who
were still slaves. He wished them to be
free also.</p>

<p>Then came an order from the Spanish rulers
that all the slaves should be gradually given
their liberty. But this was not till many
years after their black brothers in America had
been set free by that great man, President
Lincoln.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOME AGAIN.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Ramon and Maria got home that
night they told Paulina about their visit to
the quarters, and their talk with the little
domino player. Paulina knew him well, and
said he was a very bright and good boy.</p>

<p>"Some of those little negroes are too lazy,"
she declared, "but Pedro is always busy. I
wish he could go to school, for he will make
a smart man."</p>

<p>She went on to tell more of the old days.
There was one story of which she was very
fond. It was of a cargo of slaves who were
being brought to Cuba. They outwitted their
masters. This was the way they did it.</p>

<p>After the ship had been sailing for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
days, it began to leak badly. The water
poured in so fast that all hands were kept
busy pumping it out. It seemed, after a
while, to rush in faster than the men could
get it out. The ship's carpenter went around
the vessel, and hunted in every part, but could
not find a single leak.</p>

<p>"It is the work of the evil one," cried
the captain.</p>

<p>The slaves wrung their hands, and wailed,
while the crew worked at the pumps till they
were quite worn out. When it seemed as
though the ship must soon sink, an island
came in sight. The Spaniards quickly lowered
provisions and water into the small boats, and
rowed away, leaving the slaves to die, as they
supposed.</p>

<p>But they had no sooner got well out of
reach than the ship began to rise out of the
water. The black people could be seen dancing
about on the deck in delight. The sails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
were set to the wind, and away sped the
vessel.</p>

<p>How was it possible? This was the whole
story. The prisoners had gotten hold of some
knives, with which they cut through the outer
planking of the vessel. Of course, it began to
leak sadly. But when the carpenter searched
for these leaks the slaves had cleverly filled the
holes with plugs packed with oakum, and he
could not find them.</p>

<p>In this way the whole cargo of negroes succeeded
in getting out of the clutches of the
Spaniards. Old Paulina chuckled as she told
the story and thought of the cleverness of
her people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>STARTLING NEWS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a pleasant evening in February.
The children felt gay and happy, for their
father was getting so much stronger. Why,
this very day he had walked with them a
mile in an excursion to a cave. Miguel had
told them such wonderful things about it,
they begged their father to take them there.
Although they lived so near, they had never
happened to visit it before.</p>

<p>When they reached the spot, they were
obliged to crouch down in order to enter the
cave. The opening was merely a small hole
between the rocks. But, as they crept down
under the ground, the passage grew wider, and
led into a large room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose Robinson Crusoe's cave
was anything like this?" Maria asked her
brother.</p>

<p>But the answer was, "I don't think so;
you know it was not beautiful. And see here,
Maria, look at those shining pendants hanging
from the roof. They are as clear as diamonds.
Oh, look down beside your feet; there are
more of those lovely things; they are reaching
up to meet those coming from above."</p>

<p>"What makes them, papa?"</p>

<p>Señor Diaz then explained to the children
that there must be a great deal of lime in the
rocks overhead, and that, when the water
slowly filtered through the roof of the cave,
it brought with it the lime which formed in
these wonderful crystals.</p>

<p>"People pay great sums of money for
precious stones," said their father, "but what
could be more beautiful than these shining
pyramids! The pendants hanging from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
roof are called stalactites. Those reaching up
from the floor of the cave are stalagmites.
Do you suppose you can remember such
hard words, my dear little Isabella? But
come, children, I have something else to
show you here."</p>

<p>He led the children to a little pond, in
which they could dimly see, by the light of
the torch, fish sporting about in the water.</p>

<p>"Those fishes are happy as can be, yet they
are perfectly blind. I made some experiments
years ago that led me to discover it. You see
how dark it is. The creatures living here
would have no use for eyesight, so they gradually
became blind. We can only keep the
organs of our body in good condition by using
them."</p>

<p>It was no wonder the children enjoyed the
day with their father, as he always had so
much of interest to tell them. This evening,
as they sat on the balcony, Maria was talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
about the fish that lived in darkness, when
Ramon suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Look! look! the garden is fairly alive
with lights. The cucujos are giving us a display
of fireworks. Let's catch them, and have
some fun. Except in the rainy season, it is
not often that we see so many." He ran into
the house for a candle, and the three children
were soon chasing the cucujos along the walks.</p>

<p>The light of the candle attracted the insects,
then it was an easy matter to catch hundreds
of them in a fine thread net. We should call
them fireflies, but they are much larger and
more brilliant than any insect we have ever
seen.</p>

<p>As they floated along above the flowers,
Maria said they always made her think of
fairies with their torch-bearers. The light was
soft and cloud-like, yet it was bright enough to
show the colours of the flowers, although the
night was quite dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not make a belt of them for your
waists, as well as necklaces and bracelets?"
Ramon asked his sisters. "Then you can go
in and show yourselves to mother. You can
tell her you are all ready for a party."</p>

<p>"All right," answered the girls. "But you
must help us, Ramon."</p>

<p>How could the children do such things
without hurting the beautiful little creatures,
we wonder. But they knew a way, as they
had done them before.</p>

<p>Each cucujo has a tiny hook near its head,
which can be fastened in a person's clothing
without harming it in the least. Grown-up
ladies in Havana often adorn themselves in
this way when going to a party. They look
very brilliant, I assure you.</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before Maria and
Isabella were fairly ablaze with lights. Then
they danced into the house to be admired by
their parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now let's take them off and put them in
those wicker cages you made last summer,
Ramon," said Isabella. "I'm sure the poor
little things are tired of hanging from our
clothes. They must wish to fly around once
more. They will not mind being shut up in
the cages for a day or two, if we give them
plenty of sugar to eat."</p>

<p>"All right, but I wouldn't keep them shut
up long enough to make pets of them,"
said her brother. "I cannot help believing
they would rather be free."</p>

<p>As he said these words, there was a step on
the garden walk, and a moment later a strange
man stood in front of the children.</p>

<p>"Is your father at home?" he asked. "I
have a message for him."</p>

<p>Ramon hurried into the house. Señor Diaz
came out and spoke with the stranger in low
tones. When he went back into the sitting-room
he carried in his hand a piece of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that looked perfectly blank. The stranger
had disappeared again into the darkness.</p>

<p>"What did the children's good father do
with that paper?" you ask.</p>

<p>He went quickly to his desk and put it
under lock and key. Nothing could be done
with it till the morning sun should light up
the eastern sky.</p>

<p>"Then what?" you curiously ask again.</p>

<p>If we could have watched Señor Diaz, we
should have seen him go to his desk once
more, take out the precious paper, and go over
it with a hair pencil dipped in a bottle of
colorless liquid.</p>

<p>After that, we should have seen Maria running
with the paper to the window, where the
sun's rays would dry it quickly. Lo and behold!
writing began to appear which threw the
whole family into a great state of excitement.
These were the words:</p>

<p>"The U. S. warship <i>Maine</i> has been blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
up. The Americans are roused. They believe
without doubt that the Spaniards are the
doers of the terrible deed. Victory shall be
ours at last, for the United States will now
surely take our part against Spain."</p>

<p>There was no signature to the letter.</p>

<p>That very night Maria's household were
wakened by a brilliant light pouring into their
windows. It came from the burning plantation
where Lucia had her home. When
morning dawned there was no trace of a building
left on the whole place. No person was
injured, however, but Lucia and her parents
went to friends in Havana. The rich planter
had become a poor man in a single night.</p>

<p>Who had set the fire? It was probably the
insurgents, who had discovered that the
planter was a friend of the Spaniards and was
secretly working against the freedom of Cuba.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FIRST YEARS IN THE NEW WORLD.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Papa</span> dear," said Maria, one evening not
long after this, "why did our people ever
leave Spain and come here to make a home
for themselves? Of course, they had heard
what a beautiful island it is, but was that the
only reason?"</p>

<p>"They had indeed heard this, my child, but
they also believed they could become rich by
raising sugar-cane or tobacco. Great fortunes
were made in the old days on the plantations
here. My own grandfather was a very wealthy
man.</p>

<p>"But you know the story of Cuba since
then. The heavy taxes and the cruel laws of
Spain caused my relatives, as well as thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of other families, to lose their fortunes. We
have tried to free ourselves many times but
have not succeeded yet."</p>

<p>"Well, don't be sad, papa dear; the good
time is coming quickly now, you know. We
have not had as hard a time as the poor
savages Columbus found here, anyway. How
I do pity them!" said Maria, with her eyes
full of tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, they had a sad time of it indeed,"
her father went on. "They thought at first
the white men were angels and the boats they
sailed in were beautiful birds that had brought
the visitors straight from heaven. But they
soon changed their minds.</p>

<p>"Columbus was greatly excited when he
looked upon the plants and trees so different
from any he had ever seen. He said: 'I will
call this place the "Pearl of the Antilles,"'
and so it has been called to this day. He
also wrote of it, 'It is as much more grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and beautiful than any other land as the day
is brighter than the night.'</p>

<p>"I suppose you know, Maria, that Columbus
visited Cuba four times, and yet he never
discovered that it was an island."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me more about the
savages he found here," Maria said. "Of
course, I know there is not a trace of them
left in the land. Their hard work in the
mines and the cruel treatment of the Spaniards
soon killed them off. Oh, it is a wicked,
wicked shame!"</p>

<p>"Their skins were bronze in colour, like
the Indians of North America; but they did
not know where their own people came from.
Once they were asked this question by one of
the white strangers. They only answered by
pointing their hands upward. It was as much
as to say, 'From heaven!'</p>

<p>"The women had long and beautiful hair,
but the men had no beards whatever. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
painted their bodies with the red earth so
common on the island, and adorned their
heads with the feathers of brilliant birds.</p>

<p>"They lived mostly in the open air, and
slept in hammocks under the trees. They
made their hammocks out of the wild cotton
you have seen growing in the fields. The
women spun and wove this into the only
cloth they ever used.</p>

<p>"They had no gardens. They had no need
to plough and plant, for nature gave them all
they needed. There were many fruits growing
wild then, as now. They picked the
delicious mangoes, bananas, and custard-apples
which were so plentiful. They gathered the
yams and maize which also grew wild all over
the island. What more could they wish?"</p>

<p>"I should think they would have liked a
little meat once in awhile," said Maria, who
had been very much interested in everything
her father said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, "these savages liked
hunting, and often brought home game to be
roasted. They were very fond of the meat of
the iguana. You have often seen this reptile,
Maria."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she replied; "Ramon shot
one only the other day. It is like a big
lizard."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true. The Indians also
hunted the voiceless dog, as we sometimes
call the creature even now. I hardly know
why the Spaniards gave it such a name. It
is more like a rabbit than any other animal.
There were great numbers on the island in
the old times."</p>

<p>"You said the Indians slept mostly in hammocks,"
said Maria. "Didn't they have any
houses?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but they stayed in them very
little, except during the rains. They built
them of wood and palm leaves. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
clustered together in villages. Sometimes there
were two or three hundred houses in one
settlement, while several families used one
house in common."</p>

<p>"How did they defend themselves?" Maria
asked, as her father stopped speaking.</p>

<p>"They had lances pointed with sea shells,
and wooden swords," he replied. "These
were more for show than for use, for you
know they were a sober, peaceful people.
Such weapons would have been of little use
if they had tried to fight with the Spaniards.
The easiest thing would have been for them
to leave the island and seek a new home. But
they were not wise enough for that, although
they had large canoes in which they might
have travelled to some distance. They dug
them out of the trunks of trees. Some of them
were large enough to hold fifty men. Their
oars were well shaped, but they used them
only as paddles. They had no row-locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"They were a happy people, although quiet
and serious in most of their ways. They used
to dance and sing at their merry-makings, and
their music was quite sweet."</p>

<p>"Papa dear, if you are not too tired, won't
you tell me again about the great Spaniard
who was entertained by the Indians? It was
before they learned to fear the white strangers,
and they still believed they were friends."</p>

<p>"Let me see, little daughter. Oh, yes,
now I know whom you mean. I told you
that story long ago. I am surprised you
should remember it.</p>

<p>"It was Bartholomew Columbus, who was
sent to act as governor during the admiral's
absence. He passed from one place to another
on the island to collect tribute from the chiefs.
These chiefs had already learned how eager
the Spaniards were for gold; so they gave it to
the governor freely and cheerfully. That is,
of course, those who had it. But if they could
not give this they presented the white man
with quantities of the wild cotton.</p>

<p>"There was one chief who prepared a grand
entertainment in honour of his visitors. A procession
of women came out to meet them, each
one bearing a branch of the palm-tree. This
was a sign of submission. After the women,
came a train of young girls with their long hair
hanging over their graceful shoulders.</p>

<p>"A great feast was spread in the chief's
palace and the visitors were entertained with
music and dancing. When night came, a cotton
hammock was given to each to sleep in.</p>

<p>"For four days the feasting and games and
dancing were kept up. Then the visitors were
loaded with presents and their dark-coloured
hosts kept them company for quite a distance
as they journeyed onward to the next stopping-place.</p>

<p>"Could any people do more to show themselves
friendly than these poor, gentle savages?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Ah! how sadly they were repaid for their trust
in the white men!</p>

<p>"But come, we have thought enough about
the past. Let us return to the present and the
great things that are daily happening around
us."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MERRIMAC.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> day now was full of excitement for
the Diaz family. Letters were often brought
to the house by some secret messenger. Each
time they told of some new and surprising
event.</p>

<p>The insurgents were braver than ever before.
They dared more because they knew of the
good friends coming to help them. Yes, the
United States was getting troops ready to meet
the Spaniards on Cuban soil. And our great
war-ships were gathering also. They, too, were
coming to help Cuba.</p>

<p>The great battle-ship <i>Oregon</i> was speeding
through two oceans that she, also, might take
part. The eyes of the whole world were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
watching her voyage, and millions of people
were praying for her safety. How we love the
<i>Oregon</i> to-day and the brave captain and sailors
who brought her safely through her long
journey!</p>

<p>One little American boy, only nine years
old, felt so sorry for the suffering children of
Cuba that he wrote these words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"War, war, war on Spain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who blew up our beautiful, beautiful <i>Maine</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Think of the poor little Cuban dears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Think of their hardships, their sorrows, their tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who die every day for the want of some food;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wouldn't you be in a fighting mood?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then hurrah! for the soldiers who nobly do fight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the cause of the weak and for Nature's great right."</span><br />
</div>

<p>This is not very good poetry, but it shows
the deep feeling of our children for their little
Cuban cousins.</p>

<p>Maria, in her pretty little home under the
palm-trees, was spared, yet, as she and we
knew, there were thousands of children no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
older than herself who suffered and died before
Cuba was free. Our little cousin was delighted
when she knew that the American fleet was
actually close to the shores of her land.</p>

<p>But the Spanish war-vessels were here too.
They were lying in the harbour of Santiago.
It was at the other end of the island, but news
passed from one to another very quickly
among the insurgents. Ramon drew pictures
of the two fleets as he imagined they looked.
He made new pictures every day. How he
longed to see them with his own eyes! I
really fear that he would have run away from
home and joined the army at this exciting time,
if he had not loved his parents so dearly.</p>

<p>Why did the Spanish fleet stay in the harbour
of Santiago? Why did they not go out
and meet the American war-ships? Were they
afraid? It certainly seemed so. They believed
they were in a very safe place. There
was only a narrow entrance to the harbour. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was defended at each side of this opening, for
on the left were new batteries which had lately
been set up, and on the right was the grand
old Morro Castle which had stood there for
hundreds of years. In the olden times it had
defended Cuba against her enemies more than
once.</p>

<p>"Morro" means hill, and the fortress at
Santiago was well named, for it is built on a
rocky promontory several hundred feet high,
at the junction of the open sea and the San
Juan River.</p>

<p>Mines were sunk in the narrow entrance to
the harbour so that, if the American ships
should dare to enter, they would explode these
mines and be destroyed like the <i>Maine</i>. It
was no wonder the Spanish admiral thought
they were safe in staying where they were.</p>

<p>Then it happened that a young American
thought of a plan by which the Spaniards
might be caught in a trap. His name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Lieutenant Hobson. It was a very daring
plan, but he was a wonderfully brave man.</p>

<p>He said to Admiral Sampson, who commanded
the American fleet:</p>

<p>"Let me take the <i>Merrimac</i>. It is a coaling
vessel and very heavy. It has six hundred
tons of coal on board. We can place torpedoes
in different parts of the ship. A few
men can help me sail her into the channel.
When the narrowest part is reached we will
fire off the torpedoes and escape from her before
she sinks. That is, we will do so if we
can. But the <i>Merrimac</i> will be across the
narrow channel and the Spanish ships cannot
get out. Our own ships will then be free to
attack another part of the island. The Spanish
seamen will have to remain where they are
till they are glad to surrender."</p>

<p>Admiral Sampson had thought of many
plans, but he liked this one of Lieutenant
Hobson's best of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>But who should be chosen to go with the
brave man on this dangerous errand? Chosen!
Why, there were hundreds who asked to share
his danger, and only six could go with him.
You would have thought it was some great
festival they longed to take part in, if you
could have seen how disappointed the men
were, who had begged to go and were refused.</p>

<p>But no, it was a fight with death. To begin
with, the <i>Merrimac</i> must pass the batteries and
Morro Castle. She and those on board might
easily be destroyed before she reached the
place where the work was to be done. And
then, when her own torpedoes should be fired
off, how could Hobson and his men expect to
escape from the sinking ship?</p>

<p>But they were risking their lives in the cause
of those who needed their help. You and
I know now that they were brought safely
through all the dangers which surrounded
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Merrimac</i> passed the guns of the
Morro unharmed, for the Spaniards were poor
marksmen. She reached the narrow channel
where Hobson meant to do his great work.
But a shot from the batteries knocked away
her rudder, so they could not steer her across
the narrow channel. Then a great mine exploded
under her and tore a big hole in her
side. She began to sink.</p>

<p>Hobson and his men lay flat upon the deck.
Shells and bullets came whizzing about them.
They dared not rise, even though the ship
was breaking apart as the shells crashed
through her sides.</p>

<p>At length the <i>Merrimac</i> had sunk so low
that the water was up to her deck. A raft
floated close to the men. It was one they had
brought with them to help in escaping. They
caught hold of the edges and kept their heads
above water.</p>

<p>Just then a Spanish launch drew near. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
men on board were about to fire when Hobson
cried out and asked if an officer were in the
boat, as he wished to surrender. Admiral
Cervera, the commander of the Spanish fleet,
had himself sent the boat. He ordered the
firing to cease and accepted Hobson and his
men as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>When the news of Hobson's brave deed
reached Maria, she could think of nothing else
for days afterward. She would picture him in
his cell at Morro Castle, looking out to sea
where the American fleet were still cruising.</p>

<p>"How proud of him they must all be!"
she cried to Ramon.</p>

<p>"They can't be any prouder of him than we
are to have such friends as he," the boy replied.
"Why, he will be looked upon now as
one of the greatest heroes the world ever
knew. I shall always be proud of Morro
Castle because of his having been confined
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know, we went all over the place when
we were little, Maria. I believe he is kept
prisoner in that part of the castle which is built
over the water cave. You know we heard that
he can look far out on the sea from his
windows.</p>

<p>"Think of the dungeons underneath, where
people were locked up years ago. We peeked
into one of them that day we visited the fortress
and I remember how dark and damp
they were. I do hope Hobson is treated well
and won't have to stay at Morro very long."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>VICTORY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was only a few mornings after the news
of Hobson's brave venture. The children
were out in the garden, where Ramon had discovered
a chameleon on a grass plot. It was
a sunny day, so perhaps that was the reason the
chameleon's skin was such a bright green.</p>

<p>"You know how gray they look on dull
days," said Ramon. "Perhaps if I should put
him on the branch of that tree, now, he would
change to a brownish tint, to look as much as
possible like it. He's a stupid little thing,
though. If he does change colour, I don't
believe he knows it himself. Mother Nature
takes care of him, you know, and makes him
change as a kind of protection. He has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
way of defending himself, but if he is of the
same colour as the substance around him, it is
hard for his enemies to find him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! it makes me laugh when I
think of a battle I once saw between two
chameleons. They stood facing each other.
Their small eyes glared as they slowly opened
and shut their jaws like pairs of scissors.
They moved about once a minute. I did not
have time to see which won the battle; it took
too long a time for them to do anything."</p>

<p>As the children stood watching the lizard
they heard the sound of hoofs down the road.
Then there was a cloud of dust as a horseman
came riding rapidly along. He turned in at
the driveway.</p>

<p>"What news? What news?" cried Ramon,
who rushed to meet him.</p>

<p>It was an old friend of the family who had
given secret help to the Cuban soldiers throughout
their struggle for freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, you knew the American troops
had landed, didn't you? Well, run in and ask
your father to come out. I can only stop a
moment and I have much to tell him."</p>

<p>The gentleman had hardly stopped speaking
before Señor Diaz appeared on the veranda.
He was told about the position of the Americans
not far from Santiago. They had met
General Garcia, the brave leader of the insurgents.
The Cuban and American armies were
now working together. Battles had already
been fought with the common enemy.</p>

<p>But that which interested the children most
was the story of the Rough Riders and their
daring charges at El Caney and San Juan Hill.
Many of these Rough Riders were men who
had led a wild life on the plains in America.
Some of them had no book-learning; they
were not what one usually calls "gentlemen;"
but they were great horsemen and brave
soldiers. They feared nothing in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>They were commanded by Colonel Wood,
and had been recruited by Lieutenant-Colonel
Roosevelt, who had been out on the plains
among them when a young man. He admired
their spirit and was glad to be their
commander now. He knew their ways. He
led them up the San Juan heights when the
enemy was protected by forts and shooting
right and left at the Americans. But the
Rough Riders charged onward with great
courage and gained the summit. They
took possession of the blockhouse at the
top, and killed most of the Spaniards and
drove the rest away. It was a glorious fight
and a glorious victory.</p>

<p>"A few more deeds like that, and war and
trouble will be ended for us," said the gentleman
as he rode away to carry the good news
to others.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Lawton and Roosevelt!"
shouted Ramon as he danced about the garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"Santiago will soon be out of the hands of the
Spaniards, and they will be clearing out of Cuba
altogether. It seems as though I could not
rest without shaking hands with our American
friends."</p>

<p>The dear boy did not have long to wait, for
the very next day came the news that the
Spanish fleet had been destroyed. It had tried
to escape out of the harbour, but had been
discovered by the watchful Yankees. In a few
hours all of Spain's war-ships had been sunk or
driven ashore.</p>

<p>What was now left for Cuba's tyrants? The
battle-ships of the Great Republic were ranged
along her shores unharmed and strong as ever.
The Spanish troops were shut up in the city
without hope of escape. Surrender was the
only thing possible to ward off great loss of
life on both sides.</p>

<p>The Spanish commander made a formal surrender
to General Shafter, and Spain's empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the West Indies came to an end almost on
the very spot where it had begun four hundred
years before.</p>

<p>And now the mines were taken out of the
harbour and our battle-ships could enter in
safety. As our vessels glided inside one after
another they made a wonderful picture. The
harbour seemed alive with boats, and it looked
like a floating city.</p>

<p>Still grander was the sight on land when
thousands gathered around the governor's
beautiful palace at Havana to see the stars
and stripes of America unfurled. As the flag
spread its folds to the breeze, the band struck
up the air we love so well. It was the "Star
Spangled Banner." Boom! boom! went the
cannon, and thousands of American and Cuban
hearts were filled with joy.</p>

<p>"Victory! Victory!" shouted Ramon, when
the good news reached him that night. And
"Victory!" cried little Isabella, who added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with all her childish might, "Long live Cuba."
Even the parrot echoed the words of the children.
He seemed to feel that something very
great must have happened, for his voice was
shriller than usual.</p>

<p>In fact, the family could have no peace in
the house, even if there were peace all over
Cuba, till Master Poll's cage had been covered
with a thick, dark cloth, and he was made to
believe that night had suddenly fallen upon
his home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HAVANA.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Children</span>, would you like to go to Havana
and visit our good friend Señor Alvarez
for a week? He has invited us all to come
and talk over the good fortune that has come
to our land. You can have a good time seeing
the sights."</p>

<p>Of course the children were delighted at
their father's words; so it came to pass that
Maria found herself, a day or two afterward, in
a beautiful home in the very heart of the great
city.</p>

<p>It was a grand house to her childish eyes.
It was all of stone, covered with a yellowish
stucco. It was at least a hundred years old,
she was told. It was built around the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sides of an open square, and had no piazzas on
the outside like her own home. But the court
inside was very beautiful. A fountain played
here all day long, and there were blossoming
plants standing in pots on the marble floor.</p>

<p>The family spent much of their time on the
verandas in this court. It was far pleasanter
than inside the house, where the windows were
so heavily barred that they made one not used
to the custom feel almost as if he were in a
prison. The doors of the house were bullet-proof
to make it safe against attack. There
was but one entrance to the house, and that
led directly into the court. Here the family
carriage always stood unless it was in use.</p>

<p>The gentleman who lived here had one son,
a little older than Ramon. He showed the
children all around the city. As they went
from place to place, he told them how hard
his father had worked to raise money for the
Cuban soldiers. His mother sold all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
jewels, that she might help, too. But they
had to do this secretly, of course. If the
Spaniards had discovered it, they might have
lost their lives. This boy's name was Blanco.
He was a fine, manly fellow, and was looking
forward now to coming to America.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Harvard College," he told
Maria. "I wish to be a minister, but I'm
afraid if I do become one, I shall not feel like
praying for the Spaniards."</p>

<p>The boy's heart was still bitter, but perhaps
he will feel more kindly when he grows
older.</p>

<p>One day he took his young friends out to
Morro Castle. Havana has a hill fortress of
that name, as well as Santiago. Although
Hobson and his men had never been imprisoned
in this one, yet the Diaz children
were glad to see it.</p>

<p>It stood on a rocky point reaching into the
sea. The great guns were still pointing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
between the masses of yellow stone. But they
were silent. The American flag was waving
and peace ruled in the land, although soldiers
were on guard here and all through the
city.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i114.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="people looking at fort in the distance flying the American Flag" />
<div class="caption">"THE AMERICAN FLAG WAS WAVING AND PEACE RULED
IN THE LAND"</div>
</div>

<p>At the far end of the fortress was a tall
lighthouse. It stood like a sentinel to stand
watch against possible danger. Once upon a
time a wall reached from the great fort in both
directions around the city of Havana. But
now there was scarcely a trace of it left.</p>

<p>"How narrow and dirty the streets are,"
said Maria as they left the Morro. "I must
say I would rather live in the country, if I
could choose for myself."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter so much about the
width of the streets," said Blanco, "or the
poor sidewalks, either. Because, you know,
we almost always ride. The working people
are the ones who walk. But I do not like
the dirt. That is all the fault of the Spaniards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
They taxed us enough, but they kept the
money for themselves.</p>

<p>"Last summer I was very sick with yellow
fever. Mother thought I would not get well.
She said she believed we had so much of this
dreadful disease because the city is allowed to
be so unclean.</p>

<p>"But look quickly at that Punch and Judy
show! Let's stop and watch it. There is a
man playing the harp to make it more entertaining."</p>

<p>The children leaned out of the carriage to
see the show. Isabella had never seen Punch
and Judy before, and she was greatly delighted.
In a few minutes they moved on, but soon
stopped again, for here stood a man turning
a hand-organ with a monkey beside him
dressed in a most ridiculous little suit of
clothes. The monkey was dancing to the
music. Suddenly he gave a spring and landed
in the carriage right in Maria's lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Off came the monkey's cap into his little
hands, and with the most solemn look it was
held up to each of the children in turn.</p>

<p>"Take that, you poor little beggar," said
Ramon as he put a silver coin into the cap.
Down jumped the monkey and off he scampered
to his master.</p>

<p>There were many odd sights for the little
country cousins. Among them were Chinese
peddlers showing the pretty ornaments which
had been brought across the ocean. Once the
children passed a cow that was being led home
after her morning's work. She had gone with
her master from house to house, stopping long
enough at each place for her to give as much
milk as the people wished.</p>

<p>The cow was followed by a man leading
a long train of mules. They were laden with
empty baskets. They, too, were going home,
as they had left their loads at the markets in
the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was quite hot and the party hurried
home to rest during the noon hours, for, of
course, every one took a nap at this time of the
day. They might not all lie down; perhaps
some of those who had stores in the busy part
of the city would not leave their places of
business; they might only lean back and doze
in their chairs; but they would certainly keep
quiet and close their eyes, if nothing more.
It made one think of the story of the "Sleeping
Beauty" to see Havana at twelve o'clock,
noon, in the summer season.</p>

<p>As for Maria, the dainty maiden quite enjoyed
her rest at the great city house. She
could lie very comfortably in a hammock while
a little negro girl kept off the flies and mosquitoes
with a big fan. She needed the nap
in the city more than at home because she was
awakened so early by the bells.</p>

<p>Perhaps the children enjoyed Sunday more
than any other day during their stay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
city, for it was then that they visited the
cathedral containing the tomb of Columbus.
There were many churches and grand buildings
in Havana, but none could interest the children
like this.</p>

<p>It was not very far from the house, but they
all went in the carriage, carrying with them the
mats to kneel on during the service. It was
a grand old stone building, overgrown with
moss. There were many bells in the two high
towers. They were pealing loudly as the party
drove up.</p>

<p>"Just think how old it is," whispered Maria
to her brother as they entered the building.
"Blanco says that some of the bells were
brought from Spain more than two hundred
years ago. Do look at the beautiful marble
pillars, Isabella. Isn't it a grand place?"</p>

<p>It was not yet time for the service to begin,
so Blanco led the children to the tomb of Columbus,
where his ashes had rested for so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
years. It was at the right of the high altar.
All that could be seen was a marble tablet
about seven feet square. Above it stood a
bust of the great discoverer.</p>

<p>"They say that Spain has asked the right
to have the ashes, and America is going to let
her take them. But we shall still have the
tomb and the grand old cathedral where they
have rested so long," said Blanco.</p>

<p>"Now come and admire the altar."</p>

<p>It stood on pillars of porphyry and was fairly
covered with candlesticks, images, and gaudy
decorations. Somehow they did not go well
with the simple beauty of the rest of the church.
But the children admired it, for they were
ready to admire everything.</p>

<p>When the service was over, they drove out
by the governor-general's palace. It was his
no longer, however. The American general
who had charge of the city lived here now.
No doubt he enjoyed the beautiful gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and ponds. He was very active in improving
the city. Yes, the work had already begun,
and in a few months Maria would no longer
be able to complain of the dirt in Havana.</p>

<p>She could say again, but with a different
thought in her busy little mind, "To-morrow
is another day."</p>

<p>Yes, although it is but a short time since
Maria's visit to Havana, even now everything
is changed in the Diaz family. The good
father no longer worries; he is fast getting to
be a strong, healthy man. He has a fine position
under the new government, and Maria
lives in a new home just outside the city of
Havana. She is rapidly learning to speak
English, while one of her dearest friends is a
little American girl who has lately made her
home in Cuba.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>The Little Colonel.</div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its
heroine is a small girl, who is known as the Little
Colonel, on account of her fancied resemblance to an
old-school Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and
old family are famous in the region. This old Colonel
proves to be the grandfather of the child.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>The Giant Scissors.</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France,&mdash;the wonderful house with the gate of The
Giant Scissors, Jules, her little playmate, Sister Denisa,
the cruel Brossard, and her dear Aunt Kate. Joyce is
a great friend of the Little Colonel, and in later volumes
shares with her the delightful experiences of the "House
Party" and the "Holidays."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2ad2" id="Page_2ad2">[2]</a></span></p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Two Little Knights of Kentucky,</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is
not, however, the central figure of the story, that place
being taken by the "two little knights," Malcolm and
Keith, little Southern aristocrats, whose chivalrous natures
lead them through a series of interesting adventures.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Cicely and Other Stories for Girls.</div>

<p>The readers of Mrs. Johnston's charming juveniles
will be glad to learn of the issue of this volume for
young people, written in the author's sympathetic and
entertaining manner.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Big Brother.</div>

<p>A story of two boys. The devotion and care of
Steven, himself a small boy, for his baby brother, is the
theme of the simple tale, the pathos and beauty of
which has appealed to so many thousands.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Ole Mammy's Torment.</div>

<p>"Ole Mammy's Torment" has been fitly called "a
classic of Southern life." It relates the haps and mishaps
of a small negro lad, and tells how he was led by
love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>The Story of Dago.</div>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
tells his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps
is both interesting and amusing.</p>

Christmas was invented by Betty Sewall, a typical child
of the Puritans, aided by her "unregenerate" brother,
Sam.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>A Little Daughter of Liberty.</div>

<p>The author's motive for this story is well indicated
by a quotation from her introduction, as follows:</p>

<p>"One ride is memorable in the early history of the
American Revolution, the well-known ride of Paul
Revere. Equally deserving of commendation is another
ride,&mdash;untold in verse or story, its records preserved
only in family papers or shadowy legend, the ride of
Anthony Severn was no less historic in its action or
memorable in its consequences."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>A Loyal Little Maid.</div>

<p>A delightful and interesting story of Revolutionary
days, in which the child heroine, Betsey Schuyler,
renders important services to George Washington and
Alexander Hamilton, and in the end becomes the wife of
the latter.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>A Little Puritan Rebel.</div>

<p>Like Miss Robinson's successful story of "A Loyal
Little Maid," this is another historical tale of a real girl,
during the time when the gallant Sir Harry Vane was
governor of Massachusetts.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>A Little Puritan Pioneer.</div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in the Puritan settlement
at Charlestown. The little girl heroine adds
another to the list of favorites so well known to the
young people in  "A Little Puritan Rebel," etc.</p>

<p>In these three stories Mrs. Johnston once more introduces
us to the "Little Colonel," the dainty maiden who has already
figured as the heroine of two previous stories, "The Little
Colonel" and "Two Little Knights of Kentucky," and who
has won her way into the hearts of old and young alike. She
is more winsome and lovable than ever.</p>

<p>Since the time of "Little Women," no juvenile heroine has
been better beloved of her child readers than Mrs. Johnston's
"Little Colonel."</p>

<p>The charm of style and historical value of Miss Robinson's
previous stories of child life in Puritan days have brought
them wide popularity. Her latest and most important book
appeals to a large juvenile public. The "knight errant" of
this story is a little Don Quixote, whose trials and their ultimate
outcome will prove deeply interesting to their reader.</p>

By <span class="smcap">Pauline Bradford Mackie</span>.</div>

<p><i>New illustrated edition.</i></p>

<div class='center'>
One volume, large 12mo, cloth, gilt top    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $1.50<br />
</div>

<p>A tale of the days of the reign of superstition in New England,
and of a brave "lyttle maide," of Salem Town, whose
faith and hope and unyielding adherence to her word of honor
form the basis of a most attractive story. A very convincing
picture is drawn of Puritan life during the latter part of the
seventeenth century.</p>


<div class='title'><span class='adtitle4'>In Kings' Houses:</span> <span class="smcap">A Tale of the Days of

<div class='center'>
One volume, large 12mo, cloth, gilt top    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $1.50<br />
</div>

<p>The story deals with one of the most romantic episodes in
English history. Queen Anne, the last of the reigning Stuarts,
is described with a strong yet sympathetic touch, and the
young Duke of Gloster, the "little lady," and the hero of the
tale, Robin Sandys, are delightful characterizations.</p>

Now for the First Time Described and Illustrated.</span>
By <span class="smcap">L. J. Bridgman</span>, author of "Mother Goose

<div class='center'>
With upwards of 100 illustrations in color, large quarto, cloth    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $1.50<br />
</div>

<p>This is a most amusing and original book, illustrated with
startlingly odd and clever drawings. If we may accept the
account given in the preface, that renowned explorer, Lemuel
Gulliver, left behind him certain memoirs which have remained
unknown to the public up to the present day. Having
now been brought to light and given to the world, these
records establish beyond a doubt their author's claim to be
regarded as the discoverer of the Bouncing Ballazoon and a
host of other creatures unknown to Darwin and Huxley.</p>
